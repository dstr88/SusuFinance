-- 0026_mail.sql — operator mailboxes rendered inside /admin.
--
--   npm run db:migrate
--
-- The two windows on /admin (admin@ and afrikanus@ here; donnie@ and hello@ on the
-- Almstins side) read from this table. A cron polls each mailbox over IMAP and
-- inserts what it finds; replies and new messages sent from /admin are written back
-- here as direction='out' so the panel shows a conversation, not just a feed.
--
-- ── DELIBERATELY NOT TENANT-SCOPED ───────────────────────────────────────────
-- Every other table in this schema carries tenant_id and every query filters on it.
-- This one does not, and that is not an oversight. Operator mail is not tenant data:
-- it is the operator's own correspondence, it belongs to no tenant, and there is no
-- tenant_id that would be correct to put here. The isolation guarantee is preserved
-- by a different mechanism — EVERY read and write path is behind requireAdminSession
-- (src/lib/adminGuard.ts), and no tenant-facing endpoint may ever join to this table.
--
-- If you are adding a query against mail_messages: it belongs under /api/admin/ or in
-- an admin-guarded .astro frontmatter. Nowhere else. A tenant must never be able to
-- reach a row here, and since there is no tenant_id column there is also no
-- accidental "forgot the WHERE clause" leak shape — the failure mode would be an
-- unguarded endpoint, so guard the endpoint.
