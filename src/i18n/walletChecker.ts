The URL is close but slightly off (<code>blur-io.xyz</code> instead of <code>blur.io</code>). When you connect your MetaMask and sign what looks like a routine transaction, you\'re actually handing over permission to drain every token from your wallet in one move.',
      example: '💸 <strong>Real example:</strong> In 2023 a fake Blur.io airdrop page drained over <strong>$1.2 million</strong> from NFT holders within hours of launch. Most victims said they "double-checked the URL" but missed a single character.',
      p2: 'These sites appear as links in Discord DMs, Twitter/X replies, Telegram groups, and even paid ads. The attacker pays for a Google ad to appear above the real site.',

We query 7 security databases — including MetaMask\'s own phishing blocklist and ScamSniffer\'s 345,000-domain database — and return a verdict in seconds. <strong>Golden rule: never click a wallet link sent in a DM.</strong>',

      p1: '<strong>Pig-butchering</strong> scams build trust over weeks or months — a new contact on a dating app or social media gradually introduces you to a "great investment opportunity." The wallet address they send has often already been reported. <strong>Honeypot tokens</strong> let you buy but block you from selling — the contract is coded to trap your funds while the developer drains the liquidity pool.',
      example: '💸 <strong>Real example:</strong> The FBI\'s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) reported <strong>$3.3 billion</strong> in crypto investment fraud in 2023 alone — the fastest-growing fraud category. Most victims had never heard of "pig butchering" before it happened to them.',
      p2: 'A rug pull looks like a legitimate token launch. Developers hype the project, liquidity pours in, then the team withdraws everything overnight and the token goes to zero.',
      tip: '✅ <strong>How our wallet checker protects you:</strong> Before sending funds to any wallet, paste the address here. We check it against GoPlus Security\'s global scam blacklist, look for honeypot patterns in associated tokens, and flag mixer use that indicates money laundering. If someone is pressuring you to send crypto quickly — that\'s the scam.',

These permissions survive long after you\'ve forgotten the site existed.',
      example: '💸 <strong>Real example:</strong> When the Multichain bridge was exploited in 2023, attackers used <strong>old approvals</strong> users had granted months earlier to drain <strong>$125 million</strong>. Many victims hadn\'t used the bridge in over a year.',
      p2: 'A compromised dApp, a rug pull, or a zero-day exploit can trigger those approvals the moment it launches — no additional signature from you required.',

Always set exact amounts instead of unlimited when a wallet gives you the choice — and revoke after every interaction you\'re done with.',

  faq: {
    title: 'Common questions & scam patterns',
    items: [
      { q: 'What is the dApp / Website checker?', a: 'It\'s a free tool that takes any URL or domain and checks it against 7 independent security databases — MetaMask\'s own phishing blocklist, ScamSniffer, GoPlus, URLScan.io, OpenPhish, Google Safe Browsing, and VirusTotal. It returns a red, yellow, or green result based on what those databases report. We do not make our own determination — we surface what the security community has already flagged.' },
      { q: 'Do you store the wallet addresses or websites I check?', a: 'No — not in readable form. The checker needs no account and no wallet connection. To keep it fast, a repeated check of the same address or URL is served from a short-lived cache, but that cache is keyed to an irreversible one-way fingerprint of what you entered, not the address or URL itself. The usage counter records only that same fingerprint. There is no way to work backward from what we store to what you checked — consistent with our rule that SusuFinance never links an address to a person.' },
      { q: 'What does a red result mean for a website?', a: 'It means one or more of the security databases we query has reported that domain. It does not mean we are calling it a scam — that determination comes from the third-party database. You should treat a red result as a serious warning, do your own additional research, and not connect your wallet until you are certain the site is legitimate.' },
      { q: 'What does a yellow result mean?', a: 'Yellow means the site is not in any blocklist, but it also has little or no security scan history — so there\'s not enough data to give a clean bill of health. New sites, obscure domains, or recently registered addresses often show yellow. Proceed with caution and verify the site through official channels before connecting.' },
      { q: 'Can I trust a site just because it shows green?', a: 'No. A green result means the site hasn\'t been reported to any of the databases we check — not that it\'s definitively safe. Brand-new phishing sites get a few hours before they\'re added to blocklists. Always double-check the exact URL in your browser bar, look for the official social media accounts, and never connect a wallet from a link sent in a DM or email.' },
      { q: 'How do wallet drainer sites work?', a: 'A wallet drainer is a website that mimics a legitimate dApp — a fake NFT mint, a fake token claim, or a fake airdrop. When you connect your MetaMask and sign a transaction, you\'re actually signing a permission that lets the attacker transfer every token out of your wallet in one move. The entire balance can be gone in seconds. The site often disappears within hours.' },
      { q: 'What is a honeypot scam?', a: 'A honeypot is a token you can buy but never sell. The scammer promotes it, you buy in, the price appears to rise — but when you try to sell, the contract blocks you. The scammer then drains the liquidity and disappears with your ETH.' },
      { q: 'What does "too good to be true" actually look like in crypto?', a: 'Guaranteed daily returns of 1–10%, "just stake your tokens in our wallet," airdrop claims that require sending tokens first, or someone in DMs offering to double your crypto. If the return sounds impossible in traditional finance, it\'s a scam in crypto.' },
      { q: 'Why would a wallet use Tornado Cash?', a: 'Tornado Cash is a mixer that breaks the on-chain link between wallet addresses. While some users value privacy, it\'s heavily used by scammers and hackers to hide the origin of stolen funds before cashing out.' },
      { q: 'Should I trust a wallet just because it has a large balance?', a: 'No. Scammers often seed wallets with worthless tokens or inflated "paper" balances to create the appearance of legitimacy. Always check if those tokens can actually be sold and what they\'re truly worth.' },
      { q: 'Is a new wallet always suspicious?', a: 'Not always — but in the context of someone pitching an investment, a wallet created in the last 30 days is a major red flag. Legitimate protocols and businesses have established on-chain history.' },
      { q: 'What should I do if this tool flags a wallet address?', a: 'Do not send funds. Screenshot the results. If someone is pressuring you to send crypto to a flagged address, that pressure itself is part of the scam. Report the address on chainabuse.com and walk away.' },
      { q: 'What should I do if the dApp checker flags a website?', a: 'Do not connect your wallet. Close the tab. Find the official project through a trusted source — their verified Twitter/X account or a well-known aggregator like DeFiLlama or CoinGecko. Report the site to MetaMask\'s phishing database at github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect.' },
      { q: 'What happens if I send crypto to the wrong chain?', a: 'It depends on the mistake. Sending to an address on the wrong blockchain — ETH to a Bitcoin address, or BTC to a Solana address — means those funds are gone. The two networks have no way to communicate and no one can reverse an on-chain transaction. The most common version on EVM chains is sending on the wrong network: an Ethereum address and a Polygon address look identical (both start with 0x), so ETH sent to the right address on the wrong network is inaccessible unless you or the recipient can access the wallet on that other chain. Always confirm the chain before sending, not after.' },

  faq: {
    title: 'Preguntas frecuentes y patrones de estafa',
    items: [
      { q: '¿Qué es el verificador de dApp / sitio web?', a: 'Es una herramienta gratuita que toma cualquier URL o dominio y lo verifica contra 7 bases de datos de seguridad independientes — la propia lista de bloqueo de phishing de MetaMask, ScamSniffer, GoPlus, URLScan.io, OpenPhish, Google Safe Browsing y VirusTotal. Devuelve un resultado rojo, amarillo o verde según lo que reportan esas bases de datos. No hacemos nuestra propia determinación — mostramos lo que la comunidad de seguridad ya ha señalado.' },
      { q: '¿Almacenan las direcciones de billetera o los sitios web que verifico?', a: 'No — no en forma legible. El verificador no requiere cuenta ni conexión de billetera. Para mantenerlo rápido, una verificación repetida de la misma dirección o URL se sirve desde una caché de corta duración, pero esa caché se indexa mediante una huella unidireccional e irreversible de lo que ingresaste, no la dirección o URL en sí. El contador de uso registra solo esa misma huella. No hay forma de retroceder desde lo que almacenamos hasta lo que verificaste — coherente con nuestra regla de que SusuFinance nunca vincula una dirección a una persona.' },
      { q: '¿Qué significa un resultado rojo para un sitio web?', a: 'Significa que una o más de las bases de datos de seguridad que consultamos ha reportado ese dominio. No significa que nosotros lo estemos llamando una estafa — esa determinación proviene de la base de datos de terceros. Debes tratar un resultado rojo como una advertencia seria, hacer tu propia investigación adicional y no conectar tu billetera hasta estar seguro de que el sitio es legítimo.' },
      { q: '¿Qué significa un resultado amarillo?', a: 'Amarillo significa que el sitio no está en ninguna lista de bloqueo, pero tampoco tiene poco o ningún historial de escaneos de seguridad — por lo que no hay suficientes datos para dar un certificado de salud limpio. Los sitios nuevos, dominios oscuros o direcciones registradas recientemente a menudo muestran amarillo. Procede con precaución y verifica el sitio a través de canales oficiales antes de conectarte.' },
      { q: '¿Puedo confiar en un sitio solo porque muestra verde?', a: 'No. Un resultado verde significa que el sitio no ha sido reportado a ninguna de las bases de datos que verificamos — no que sea definitivamente seguro. Los sitios de phishing nuevos tienen unas pocas horas antes de ser añadidos a las listas de bloqueo. Siempre verifica la URL exacta en la barra de tu navegador, busca las cuentas oficiales de redes sociales y nunca conectes una billetera desde un enlace enviado en un mensaje directo o correo electrónico.' },
      { q: '¿Cómo funcionan los sitios de wallet drainer?', a: 'Un wallet drainer es un sitio web que imita una dApp legítima — un mint falso de NFT, una reclamación falsa de token o un airdrop falso. Cuando conectas tu MetaMask y firmas una transacción, en realidad estás firmando un permiso que le permite al atacante transferir todos los tokens de tu billetera en un solo movimiento. Todo el saldo puede desaparecer en segundos. El sitio a menudo desaparece en pocas horas.' },
      { q: '¿Qué es una estafa honeypot?', a: 'Un honeypot es un token que puedes comprar pero nunca vender. El estafador lo promociona, compras, el precio parece subir — pero cuando intentas vender, el contrato te bloquea. El estafador luego drena la liquidez y desaparece con tu ETH.' },
      { q: '¿Cómo se ve "demasiado bueno para ser verdad" en cripto?', a: 'Rendimientos diarios garantizados del 1–10%, "solo pon tus tokens en nuestra billetera", reclamaciones de airdrop que requieren enviar tokens primero, o alguien en mensajes directos ofreciendo duplicar tu cripto. Si el retorno suena imposible en las finanzas tradicionales, es una estafa en cripto.' },
      { q: '¿Por qué usaría una billetera Tornado Cash?', a: 'Tornado Cash es un mixer que rompe el enlace on-chain entre direcciones de billetera. Aunque algunos usuarios valoran la privacidad, es ampliamente utilizado por estafadores y hackers para ocultar el origen de fondos robados antes de cobrarlos.' },
      { q: '¿Debo confiar en una billetera solo porque tiene un saldo grande?', a: 'No. Los estafadores a menudo cargan billeteras con tokens sin valor o saldos "de papel" inflados para crear apariencia de legitimidad. Verifica siempre si esos tokens pueden realmente venderse y cuánto valen realmente.' },
      { q: '¿Es una billetera nueva siempre sospechosa?', a: 'No siempre — pero en el contexto de alguien que ofrece una inversión, una billetera creada en los últimos 30 días es una gran señal de alerta. Los protocolos y negocios legítimos tienen historial on-chain establecido.' },
      { q: '¿Qué debo hacer si esta herramienta señala una dirección de billetera?', a: 'No envíes fondos. Toma una captura de pantalla de los resultados. Si alguien te presiona para enviar cripto a una dirección señalada, esa presión misma es parte de la estafa. Reporta la dirección en chainabuse.com y retírate.' },
      { q: '¿Qué debo hacer si el verificador de dApp señala un sitio web?', a: 'No conectes tu billetera. Cierra la pestaña. Encuentra el proyecto oficial a través de una fuente de confianza — su cuenta verificada de Twitter/X o un agregador reconocido como DeFiLlama o CoinGecko. Reporta el sitio a la base de datos de phishing de MetaMask en github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect.' },
      { q: '¿Qué pasa si envío criptomonedas a la cadena incorrecta?', a: 'Depende del error. Enviar a una dirección en una blockchain diferente — ETH a una dirección Bitcoin, o BTC a una dirección Solana — significa que esos fondos se pierden. Las dos redes no tienen forma de comunicarse y nadie puede revertir una transacción en cadena. La versión más común en cadenas EVM es enviar en la red incorrecta: una dirección Ethereum y una de Polygon son visualmente idénticas (ambas empiezan con 0x), por lo que el ETH enviado a la dirección correcta en la red incorrecta es inaccesible a menos que tú o el destinatario puedan acceder a la billetera en esa otra cadena. Siempre confirma la cadena antes de enviar, no después.' },

  faq: {
    title: 'Questions fréquentes et schémas d’arnaque',
    items: [
      { q: 'Qu’est-ce que le vérificateur de dApp / site web ?', a: 'C’est un outil gratuit qui prend n’importe quelle URL ou domaine et le vérifie auprès de 7 bases de données de sécurité indépendantes — la liste de blocage anti-phishing de MetaMask, ScamSniffer, GoPlus, URLScan.io, OpenPhish, Google Safe Browsing et VirusTotal. Il renvoie un résultat rouge, jaune ou vert selon ce que rapportent ces bases. Nous ne portons pas notre propre jugement — nous faisons remonter ce que la communauté de la sécurité a déjà signalé.' },
      { q: 'Conservez-vous les adresses de portefeuille ou les sites web que je vérifie ?', a: 'Non — pas sous une forme lisible. Le vérificateur ne demande aucun compte ni connexion de portefeuille. Pour rester rapide, une vérification répétée de la même adresse ou URL est servie depuis un cache de courte durée, mais ce cache est indexé par une empreinte unidirectionnelle et irréversible de ce que vous avez saisi, et non l’adresse ou l’URL elle-même. Le compteur d’utilisation n’enregistre que cette même empreinte. Il n’existe aucun moyen de remonter de ce que nous stockons vers ce que vous avez vérifié — conforme à notre règle selon laquelle SusuFinance ne relie jamais une adresse à une personne.' },
      { q: 'Que signifie un résultat rouge pour un site web ?', a: 'Cela signifie qu’une ou plusieurs des bases de données que nous interrogeons ont signalé ce domaine. Cela ne veut pas dire que nous le qualifions d’arnaque — ce jugement vient de la base de données tierce. Traitez un résultat rouge comme un avertissement sérieux, faites vos propres recherches supplémentaires et ne connectez pas votre portefeuille tant que vous n’êtes pas certain que le site est légitime.' },
      { q: 'Que signifie un résultat jaune ?', a: 'Le jaune signifie que le site n’est dans aucune liste de blocage, mais qu’il a peu ou pas d’historique d’analyse de sécurité — il n’y a donc pas assez de données pour lui donner un feu vert. Les sites récents, les domaines obscurs ou les adresses récemment enregistrées affichent souvent du jaune. Procédez avec prudence et vérifiez le site par des canaux officiels avant de vous connecter.' },
      { q: 'Puis-je faire confiance à un site juste parce qu’il est vert ?', a: 'Non. Un résultat vert signifie que le site n’a été signalé à aucune des bases que nous vérifions — pas qu’il est définitivement sûr. Les sites de phishing tout neufs disposent de quelques heures avant d’être ajoutés aux listes de blocage. Vérifiez toujours l’URL exacte dans la barre de votre navigateur, cherchez les comptes officiels sur les réseaux sociaux, et ne connectez jamais un portefeuille à partir d’un lien envoyé en DM ou par e-mail.' },
      { q: 'Comment fonctionnent les sites drainers de portefeuille ?', a: 'Un drainer de portefeuille est un site web qui imite une dApp légitime — un faux mint de NFT, une fausse réclamation de token ou un faux airdrop. Quand vous connectez votre MetaMask et signez une transaction, vous signez en réalité une permission qui permet à l’attaquant de transférer tous les tokens hors de votre portefeuille en une seule fois. La totalité du solde peut disparaître en quelques secondes. Le site disparaît souvent en quelques heures.' },
      { q: 'Qu’est-ce qu’une arnaque honeypot ?', a: 'Un honeypot est un token que vous pouvez acheter mais jamais vendre. L’arnaqueur en fait la promotion, vous achetez, le prix semble monter — mais quand vous essayez de vendre, le contrat vous bloque. L’arnaqueur vide alors la liquidité et disparaît avec votre ETH.' },
      { q: 'À quoi ressemble vraiment le « trop beau pour être vrai » en crypto ?', a: 'Des rendements quotidiens garantis de 1 à 10 %, « stakez simplement vos tokens dans notre portefeuille », des réclamations d’airdrop qui exigent d’envoyer des tokens d’abord, ou quelqu’un en DM proposant de doubler votre crypto. Si le rendement semble impossible dans la finance traditionnelle, c’est une arnaque en crypto.' },
      { q: 'Pourquoi un portefeuille utiliserait-il Tornado Cash ?', a: 'Tornado Cash est un mixer qui rompt le lien on-chain entre les adresses de portefeuille. Si certains utilisateurs tiennent à leur vie privée, il est largement utilisé par les arnaqueurs et les hackers pour cacher l’origine de fonds volés avant de les retirer.' },
      { q: 'Dois-je faire confiance à un portefeuille juste parce qu’il a un gros solde ?', a: 'Non. Les arnaqueurs garnissent souvent les portefeuilles de tokens sans valeur ou de soldes « sur le papier » gonflés pour donner une apparence de légitimité. Vérifiez toujours si ces tokens peuvent réellement être vendus et ce qu’ils valent vraiment.' },
      { q: "Un nouveau portefeuille est-il toujours suspect ?", a: "Pas toujours — mais dans le contexte de quelqu’un qui propose un investissement, un portefeuille créé au cours des 30 derniers jours est un signal d’alerte majeur. Les protocoles et entreprises légitimes ont un historique on-chain établi." },
      { q: "Que dois-je faire si cet outil signale une adresse de portefeuille ?", a: "N’envoyez pas de fonds. Faites une capture d’écran des résultats. Si quelqu’un vous presse d’envoyer de la crypto à une adresse signalée, cette pression fait elle-même partie de l’arnaque. Signalez l’adresse sur chainabuse.com et partez." },
      { q: "Que dois-je faire si le vérificateur de dApp signale un site web ?", a: "Ne connectez pas votre portefeuille. Fermez l’onglet. Trouvez le projet officiel via une source fiable — son compte Twitter/X vérifié ou un agrégateur reconnu comme DeFiLlama ou CoinGecko. Signalez le site à la base de phishing de MetaMask sur github.com/MetaMask/eth-phishing-detect." },
      { q: "Que se passe-t-il si j’envoie des cryptos vers la mauvaise chaîne ?", a: "Cela dépend de l’erreur. Envoyer vers une adresse sur la mauvaise blockchain — de l’ETH vers une adresse Bitcoin, ou du BTC vers une adresse Solana — signifie que ces fonds sont perdus. Les deux réseaux ne peuvent pas communiquer et personne ne peut annuler une transaction en chaîne. La version la plus courante sur les chaînes EVM est d’envoyer sur le mauvais réseau : une adresse Ethereum et une adresse Polygon sont visuellement identiques (toutes deux commencent par 0x), donc de l’ETH envoyé à la bonne adresse sur le mauvais réseau est inaccessible, sauf si vous ou le destinataire pouvez accéder au portefeuille sur cette autre chaîne. Confirmez toujours la chaîne avant d’envoyer, pas après." },
